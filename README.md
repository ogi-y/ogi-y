- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and C++ for image processing and machine learning.  
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with laser detection using machine learning techniques.  
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about underwater body measurement techniques or custom interpolation methods!  
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: hiro.ogi5647@gmail.com
